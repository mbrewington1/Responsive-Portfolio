            First, I would like to introduce myself. My name is Michelle Brewington. I love everything Pink and Green!
            My birthday
            is November 30th. I'm a Saggitarius! I am a proud graduate of TUSKEGEE UNIVERSITY! I truly love my HBCU!
            One of my interests is shopping. Even if it is just window shopping. My second interest
            is interior designing and party planning. This is where I find my happy place. I love tranforming a space
            into something beautiful.
            And lastly, my third interest is baking. I love baking even though my cakes are hit or miss. I love using
            my husband and son as my
            guinea pigs although at times they can be brutely honest, but my neice and nephews will always tell me my
            cakes are delicious even if
            it tastes like cardboard! Boy do I love my babies!!! Despite it all, I keep pushing on with my baking and
            one day, I'm going to
            get it right! And BOOM goes the dynamite!!!
        </p>
        <p>
            I would say my greatest joy is my family. My son is 18 years old and just graduated from
            high school and now is a freshman at my alma mater, TUSKEGEE UNIVERSITY! I have a sweet neice
            who just turned 6 years old. She's alot like me!!! I also have 2 nephews. One 9 and the other
            one is 3. Boy, the 3 year old sure is a handful!!! My stepson is 31! So you see...my family
            or should I say my kids, range in age vastly. They are the love of my life indeed! And BOOM goes
            the dynamite once again!!!!!
